  "about": "Hi, I’m a Front-end Developer specializing in React, TypeScript, Next.js, and modern UI design.\n \nI enjoy building fast, responsive, and user-friendly web applications with clean, maintainable code. Recently, I worked at UAB Internet Marketing Solutions, where I maintained and refactored B2B and B2C projects — improving performance, resolving front-end issues, and implementing MUI-based UI updates.\n\nI’m curious by nature — constantly asking “why does it work like that?” and “how can I make this better?” Sometimes it feels like I’m a kid again, experimenting, breaking things, fixing them, and learning along the way. AI, documentation, and the internet are my “parents,” and I’m not afraid to ask questions until I find the best solution.\n\nI’m passionate about thoughtful UI/UX decisions, simple user flows, and collaborating with designers. Right now I’m elevating my portfolio projects with stronger visual polish and full-stack functionality, and I’m always excited to learn something new.\n\nLet’s build something great — professionally, and with a little fun. 😉"
