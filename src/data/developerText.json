  "about": "Throughout my learning journey, Iâ€™ve developed several projects where I focused on blending design with usability. Building my portfolio has been an incredibly rewarding experience, as it allowed me to bring my ideas to life and trust in my creative abilities. \n\n Sometimes, I feel like a little kid constantly asking â€˜why?â€™ â€“ except this time, my â€˜parentsâ€™ are AI and the internet. Why canâ€™t it work this way? Why does it have to be like that? What if we flipped the whole thing?? The journey is full of questions, and Iâ€™m here for every single one of them! Letâ€™s tackle our problems and tasks professionally â€” but with a little fun along the way. ðŸ˜‰"
